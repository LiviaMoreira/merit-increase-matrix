# Merit Increase Matrix Project

This repository contains an IPython Notebook (`MeritIncreaseMatrix.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of a merit increase matrix in Python. The project explores the process of calculating and analyzing merit increases for employees based on their performance and position in the salary range.

## Overview

The project is structured around the following key components:

- **Problem Statement:** Explains the need for fair and appropriate salary increases and introduces the concept of a merit increase matrix.
  
- **Data Description:** Describes the fictional dataset used in the project, including key features such as employee salaries, performance grades, and compa-ratios.
  
- **Compa Ratio Calculation:** Calculates the CompaRatio for each employee and analyzes its relevance in salary fairness analysis and merit increase impact analysis.
  
- **Creation of Merit Increase Matrix:** Constructs a merit increase matrix based on the quartiles of PerformanceGrade and CompaRatio, highlighting its role in addressing performance grade variability and Compa Ratio disparities.
  
- **Function to Calculate New Salary and Merit Increase:** Defines a function to calculate the new salary and merit increase for each employee based on the merit increase matrix.
  
- **Scatter Plot of Performance Grade vs Compa Ratio:** Visualizes the relationship between performance grade, Compa Ratio, and merit increase using a scatter plot.
  
- **Comparing Before and After Scenarios:** Compares the distribution of CompaRatio across different performance grades before and after proposed merit increases.

- **Key Findings:** Summarizes the key insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## Usage
